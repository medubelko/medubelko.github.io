                <p>If you are one of the many people making the transition to life and working at home in 2020, you may have found yourself being asked or required to use Zoom to join a video call with family, friends, or for work. If you're completely new to Zoom, don't worry: it's fairly straightforward to use, and this guide will provide a quick walkthrough to get you set up and ready to join Zoom meetings.</p>
                <p>We will cover how to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#installing-zoom-on-windows">Install the Zoom desktop client</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#joining-a-zoom-meeting">Join a Zoom meeting</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>on Windows 7, 8, or 10.<p>

                <h1>Why not use the Zoom web client?</h1>
                <p>While Zoom's web client is ideal for joining and hosting one-time meetings, the desktop client gives you more options and flexibility, such as the ability to schedule meetings, record them to your computer, and more control over your privacy. This guide covers the desktop client, so your system will be ready should you need these more advanced features.</p>

                <h1 id="installing-zoom-on-windows">Installing Zoom on Windows</h1>
                <p>On Windows, the Zoom client is tied to a Windows account. If multiple accounts on the same computer need Zoom, you must install it again, separately, under those accounts. In this section, we'll show you how to install it for your account.</p>
                <p>To install Zoom on your Windows account:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Log in to your Windows account.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In a web browser such as Chrome or Firefox, navigate to the Zoom download page: <a href="https://zoom.us/download">https://zoom.us/download</a></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Download the installer under <em>Zoom Client for Meetings</em>.</p>

                <p>Zoom is now installed for your Windows account. From here, you can now join someone else's meeting, or log in to Zoom to host and schedule your own meetings.</p>

                <h1 id="joining-a-zoom-meeting">Joining a Zoom meeting</h1>
                <p>There are two ways to join a Zoom meeting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#connecting-with-a-meeting-link">With a link</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here is an example of a Zoom meeting invitation attached to a Google Calendar event, displaying both joining methods:</p>
                <a href="content/images/meeting-event.png" class="glightbox" data-glightbox="title: Joining a Zoom meeting; description: An example of a Zoom meeting invitation attached to a Google Calendar event, displaying both joining methods.">

                </a>
                <p>Both ways will allow you to connect to the meeting, but the meeting host may have only provided you with one or the other. The link is the faster method.</p>

                <p>If you have been provided with a link to the meeting:</p>
